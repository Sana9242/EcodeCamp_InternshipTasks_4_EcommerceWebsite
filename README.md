# EcodeCamp_InternshipTasks_4_EcommerceWebsite
This is a dynamic e-commerce website with several key features designed to enhance user interaction. At the core of the functionality is a header with a navigation bar and a cart icon. Clicking the cart icon toggles the visibility of a cart overlay, allowing users to view and manage their selected items. The main content is divided into a shop section and an about section. The shop section showcases products in a grid layout, each with an image, title, price, and an "add to cart" button. Users can interact with these buttons to add items to their cart, and the cart updates accordingly. The about section provides information about the products offered, emphasizing quality and customer satisfaction. The footer offers additional information and quick links. JavaScript powers the interactivity, managing cart operations such as adding and removing items, updating quantities, and handling order placements. The entire site is styled with CSS to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design across different devices.
